    <p class="textdesign">dia. i like you.  like i really like you. unang una yung hair mo, and second your caring personality. ever since the start of the year, i always looked at you and i admired you a lot. i turn my attention to you even during classes. ill give you my attention every single day. your personality makes me want to talk to you every single day. its no surprise kasi we've been talking for a while!! thank you for keeping in touch with me, when i was sick and not feeling well at all. sorry i didnt have the courage to say this face to face, since i would just stutter and ruin it. anyway, thats all i have to say ❤️❤️</p>
